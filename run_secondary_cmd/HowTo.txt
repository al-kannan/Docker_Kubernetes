You can download an image and create a local container, run the container

While the container is running, you can open an another session and run secondary command

For example busybox is a small linux file system, so when you run it you can issue a command that is long running such as ping and then on an different session you can issue a secondary command on the running container with a different ping target 

below are the commands : 

Linux sesson 1
docker run busybox ping google.com


Linux sesson 2
docker ps to get the container id 
docker exec -it <container id> ping yahoo.com

Linux sesson 3
docker ps will show only one container running but we have two commands running using the same image, pretty cool
