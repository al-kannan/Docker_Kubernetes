A typical computer will have cpu(s), memory, ports, network etc. 

On a host machine we can run Docker deamon and via Docker client we can start any number of container. 

These containers run within Docker, applications running on the container would need inputs and will produce output. 

Inputs can be copied from local file system when image is build or host machine volume can be mounted on the container or a port where appliations can receive inputs 

Container can produce output via database connection or host machine volume mounting etc. 

Many times Container will act like web server, in such case we need to map host machine port to container port, these two can be different, this is a run time mapping only

In AWS we need to open up the security group for 8080 port that we are mapping to NGNIX webserver which is running in port 80
