Accessing s3 requires awscli install and aws configure

aws configure essentially creates two files, we have just created these files part of the Dockerfile, so when we build the image we will have these two files store at /root/.aws folder

After this container can run any aws cli commands such as 
aws s3 ls

it works...pretty cool
