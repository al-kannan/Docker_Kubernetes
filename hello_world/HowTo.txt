This one line command basically does the following 
- Docker client is talking to docker deamon (containerd) that is running on this local server
- containerd looks for hello-world image in the local repository
- since it will not be in local repo, it connects to docker hub and get the image
- then a container is created from the image and gets run
- containerd creates a name space with Linux OS and start running the container 
- I do not know what language, but Hello World message gets printed
- Then container is shutdown and the control is back to docker client
